# PRE3
Website project for the final stage of the Northcoders pre-course challenges.

My intention here is to build a functional website to demonstrate the skills I have acquired from the suggested lessons on HTML and CSS. I will also be attempting to build some interactivity into the site using my limited knowledge of JavaScript.
